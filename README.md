flash-parser
============

A simple flash file parser for generating game sprites

Make sure you are using *MAC*, because the .sh file contains *open* command which only runs on MAC.

1. Install TexturePacker cmdtool.
2. Install ImageMagicka
3. Open a flash file with FLASH CS4 or above.
4. Make sure the animations are all created by classic animation.
5. Open Terminal, cd to the src folder, then type "./export.sh".
6. Select a folder to save the images and output-files.
7. The useful output-files are named output.1.pgm, output.1.ppm, output.lua
